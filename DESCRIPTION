Description: Qubole is a Big Data As a Service company. This wrapper function written in R and Python can be used to access their flagship product Qubole Data Service (qds) to launch a Hive Command (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hive) . It uses QDS Python SDK to accomplish this which instead uses rest api to communicate with Qubole (for further information see https://github.com/qubole/qds-sdk-py) . Before starting Set token variable to your qubole authentication token (which you can get from https://api.qubole.com/v2/control-panel#manage-accounts).
